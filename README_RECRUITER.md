# Introduction into Scripting – Text-Based Adventure Game

## Overview  
This project is a **Python text-based adventure game** built as part of my scripting coursework.  
It demonstrates interactive storytelling, user input handling, branching logic, and game state management.  

Players navigate through choices that affect outcomes, reinforcing concepts of conditionals, loops, and modular functions.

## Technologies  
- Python  
- Standard libraries only (no external dependencies)  
- Command line / terminal for user interaction  

## My Contributions & Highlights  
- Designed and implemented the entire game loop, including input validation and branching story paths  
- Structured the game into functions for readability and reusability (e.g., main menu, scenes, player choices)  
- Implemented input validation to prevent crashes from unexpected inputs  
- Used loops and conditional logic to create multiple endings and replayability  

## What Recruiters Should Notice  
- Strong grasp of programming fundamentals: control flow, error handling, modularity  
- Ability to translate abstract ideas (storyline, choices) into functioning code  
- Demonstrates creativity and technical execution — not just coding exercises but an actual playable project  
- A project that can be quickly run and tested, showing immediate value in my scripting skills  

## How to Run / Explore  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Run the game in terminal with:  
   ```bash
   python adventure_game.py
